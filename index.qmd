# Welcome {.unnumbered}

This book contains the source for our MA-Seminar on Multilevel Modeling of political identity and affection in Europe. The seminar is specifically designed for political science students who are interested in advanced regression models and multilevel analysis. The primary goal of this seminar is to explore the measures of political identity and affection in large surveys such as the ESS and how they fit into theories of political identity.

If you need help getting started with R and would like to recreate the examples used in this book, you can access our [R Workshop - Social Sciences](https://rloesung.github.io/RWorkshop/).

Throughout the seminar, we will cover various sessions on modeling data at multiple levels, including discussing the potential boundaries in this process. We will be using multilevel regression modeling to examine the relationship between political identity and other relevant variables such as gender, socio-economic status, and age. The multilevel approach allows us to account for the hierarchical structure of the data and estimate the effects of individual and group-level variables on the outcome of interest.

In RStudio, we will use the lme4 package, a popular tool for implementing multilevel regression models. During the book, students will have hands-on practice in using this package to analyze the data. By the end of this seminar, students will have a comprehensive understanding of how to conduct multilevel analysis using R and will be able to apply these techniques to their research projects.
