    "text": "Welcome\nThis book contains the source for our MA-Seminar on Multilevel Modeling of political identity and affection in Europe. The seminar is specifically designed for political science students who are interested in advanced regression models and multilevel analysis. The primary goal of this seminar is to explore the measures of political identity and affection in large surveys such as the ESS and how they fit into theories of political identity.\nThroughout the seminar, we will cover various sessions on modeling data at multiple levels, including discussing the potential boundaries in this process. We will be using multilevel regression modeling to examine the relationship between political identity and other relevant variables such as gender, socio-economic status, and age. The multilevel approach allows us to account for the hierarchical structure of the data and estimate the effects of individual and group-level variables on the outcome of interest.\nIn RStudio, we will use the lme4 package, a popular tool for implementing multilevel regression models. During the book, students will have hands-on practice in using this package to analyze the data. By the end of this seminar, students will have a comprehensive understanding of how to conduct multilevel analysis using R and will be able to apply these techniques to their research projects."

    "text": "1.1 Introduction to the European Social Survey 10 Dataset\nYou will be analysing data from the European Social Survey 10 from 2020, a european wide representative survey. It is a cross-national survey with a mission to monitor and interpret changing attitudes and values across Europe, investigate how they interact with changing institutions, advance cross-national survey measurement methods, and develop social indicators. Since its establishment in 2001, the survey has been administered in 40 countries, using strict random probability sampling, achieving high response rates, and implementing rigorous translation protocols.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe European Social Survey (ESS) conducted face-to-face interviews for its data collection, but due to the COVID-19 pandemic, nine countries switched to self-completion methods while 22 countries continued with face-to-face interviews, with the option of using video interviews as a backup. Caution is advised when comparing data between countries using different approaches. The fieldwork for Round 10 was carried out over a longer period than usual, and timing may be important due to pandemic-related attitudinal and behavioral changes. The survey covers 32 countries and includes two new modules, and the ESS has been established as a European Research Infrastructure Consortium since Round 7.\n\n\nWe use data from seven cohorts of young people collected in the first sweep of the study, carried out at the end of the final year of compulsory schooling (aged 16-17) when most sample members had taken Standard grades.2 These are subject-based examinations, typically taken in up to eight subjects. Each subject is graded on a scale from 1 (highest) to 7 (lowest). The dependent variable is a total attainment score calculated by assigning 7 points for a ‘1’, 6 for a ‘2’ and so on."
