    "text": "Welcome\nThis book contains the source for our MA-Seminar on Multilevel Modeling of political identity and affection in Europe. The seminar is specifically designed for political science students who are interested in advanced regression models and multilevel analysis. The primary goal of this seminar is to explore the measures of political identity and affection in large surveys such as the ESS and how they fit into theories of political identity.\nIf you need help getting started with R and would like to recreate the examples used in this book, you can access our R Workshop - Social Sciences.\nThroughout the seminar, we will cover various sessions on modeling data at multiple levels, including discussing the potential boundaries in this process. We will be using multilevel regression modeling to examine the relationship between political identity and other relevant variables such as gender, socio-economic status, and age. The multilevel approach allows us to account for the hierarchical structure of the data and estimate the effects of individual and group-level variables on the outcome of interest.\nIn RStudio, we will use the lme4 package, a popular tool for implementing multilevel regression models. During the book, students will have hands-on practice in using this package to analyze the data. By the end of this seminar, students will have a comprehensive understanding of how to conduct multilevel analysis using R and will be able to apply these techniques to their research projects."

    "text": "1.1 European Social Survey 9\nYou will be analysing data from the European Social Survey 9 from 2018, a european wide representative survey. The European Social Survey (ESS) is a multi-country survey conducted in over 38 countries with the aims of monitoring and interpreting changing public attitudes and values within Europe, advancing cross-national survey measurement methods, and developing European social indicators. The survey employs rigorous methodologies, including strict random probability sampling, a minimum target response rate of 70%, and rigorous translation protocols. In the ninth round, the survey covers 29 countries and is funded by ESS European Research Infrastructure Consortium (ESS ERIC) members, observers, and guests. The hour-long face-to-face interview includes questions on core topics and two modules developed for Round 9 covering Justice and Fairness in Europe, and the Timing of Life.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nWe explicitly use the ESS9 for this course, since all countries are recorded and analyzable in this data set, and there is no restricted data collection due to COVID-19."

For this we use the variable atcherp, with the following question: “And how emotionally attached do you feel to Europe?”. This is a metric variable going from 1 left to 10 right. First we want to approach the variable descriptively for every country:"
